## How to control on what node pods gets to placed ?

Node selector and Node affinity can help us achieve that .

## **Node Selectors in Brief**: 
In Kubernetes, a Node Selector is a simple way to assign a pod to a specific node (or group of nodes) based on labels.

## Why use Node selectors ?
To control where your pods run.
Example use cases:

Run database pods only on high-memory nodes.

Keep certain workloads on specific hardware (e.g., GPU nodes).

Isolate teams or environments on specific nodes.

## Commands
### Label your node
```bash
$ kubectl label nodes node-1 disktype=ssd
```
#### use nodeselector in spec of pods
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd
```
The pod will only schedule on nodes that have the label disktype=ssd.
