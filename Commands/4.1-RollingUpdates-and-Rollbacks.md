## Rolling Updates in Deployments

- basically we are learning about rolling updates and rollbacks in deployments
``` bash
$ kubectl apply -f my-deploy.yml
$ kubectl get deploy
$ kubectl get rs

# Rollout commands
$ kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp-deploy

# checking history of Rollouts
$ kubectl rollout history deployment/myapp-deploy


# check deployment startegy used in deployment
$ kubectl describe deploy deployment/myapp-deploy | grep StrategyType
```

#### Deployment strategy 
1. Recreate strategy -  In this all exisitng instances are deleted at once first and then replaces by newer version of our app instances.

2. Rolling update (default deployment strategy) - if we don't specifiy this becomes our default deployment strategy. here all the instances are replaced one by one. like a new instance is created and 1 older instance is replace or simply delete and new one takes responsibility.

under the hood, k8's create a new replicaset with new version of our instances and pods under new replicasets are brought up one by one and at same time older replicaset pods brought down one by one.

#### How do we actually apply any updates ?

we actually can use our deployment-manifest.yml and update the corresponding records with new changes and then,
```bash
$ kubectl apply -f my-dep.yml
```
else, we can do some basic updates using imperative way itself like updating images and so on.

```bash
$ kubectl set image deployment/myapp-deploy \ nginx-container=nginx:1.9.1
```

## Rollbacks

If the new changes doesn't work or any case we want to go back to our previous version of deployment we use **Rollbacks**

```bash
$ kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp-deploy

```
