## Encryption at Rest in K8's

```bash
# to check if encryption at rest is already enabled
$ ps -aux | grep kube-api | grep "encryption-provider-config"
```

**Encryption at rest**  in **Kubernetes** **protects sensitive data** (like Secrets, ConfigMaps, and Persistent Volumes) **by encrypting it before it's written to etcd**.

Note: as etcd doesn't provides any encryption by default, so we have to use Encryption at rest

üîê What It Does:
- Encrypts Kubernetes resource data stored in etcd.

- Helps meet security and compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

üß© How It Works:

Kubernetes uses encryption providers defined in an encryption configuration file. Supported providers:

- **aescbc** (recommended)

- **kms** (for external key management via providers like HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS)

- **secretbox**

- **identity** (no encryption, for testing/migration)

üìÑ Sample Encryption Config:
```yaml
apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: EncryptionConfiguration
resources:
  - resources:
      - secrets
    providers:
      - aescbc:
          keys:
            - name: key1
              secret: <base64-encoded-32-byte-key>
      - identity: {}
  ```    
üìå Steps to Enable:
1. Generate a 32-byte base64-encoded key:

```bash
$ head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64
```
2. Create the encryption config file and save it to a secure path on the master node.

3. Edit the kube-apiserver manifest (usually under /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml) and add:

```yaml
--encryption-provider-config=/path/to/encryption-config.yaml
Restart kube-apiserver (will restart automatically if managed as a static pod).
```
4. üîÅ Re-encrypt Existing Data (Optional):
Use this to encrypt data that already exists in etcd:

```bash
$ kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | \
$ kubectl replace -f -
```
#### Note on secrets

Remember that secrets encode data in base64 format. Anyone with the base64 encoded secret can easily decode it. As such the secrets can be considered not very safe.

The concept of safety of the Secrets is a bit confusing in Kubernetes. The Kubernetes documentation page and a lot of blogs out there refer to secrets as a ‚Äúsafer option‚Äù to store sensitive data. They are safer than storing in plain text as they reduce the risk of accidentally exposing passwords and other sensitive data. In my opinion, it‚Äôs not the secret itself that is safe, it is the practices around it.

Secrets are not encrypted, so it is not safer in that sense. However, some best practices around using secrets make it safer. As in best practices like:

Not checking in secret object definition files to source code repositories.
Enabling Encryption at Rest for Secrets so they are stored encrypted in ETCD.
Also, the way Kubernetes handles secrets. Such as:

A secret is only sent to a node if a pod on that node requires it.

Kubelet stores the secret into a tmpfs so that the secret is not written to disk storage.

Once the Pod that depends on the secret is deleted, kubelet will delete its local copy of the secret data as well.

Read about the protections https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#protections and risks https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#risks of using secrets here https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#risks.

Having said that, there are other better ways of handling sensitive data like passwords in Kubernetes, such as using tools like Helm Secrets, and HashiCorp Vault https://www.vaultproject.io/.
