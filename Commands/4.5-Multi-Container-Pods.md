##  Multi-Container Pods in Kubernetes


A multi-container pod is a pod that runs more than one container, which share the same network namespace, storage (volumes), and lifecycle.

#### Why Use Multi-Container Pods?
- **Sidecar Pattern**: One container extends or enhances the functionality of another (e.g., logging, proxying).

- **Adapter Pattern**: One container transforms data for another.

- **Ambassador Pattern**: One container acts as a proxy to another system.

Example Yaml:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: multi-container-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: main-app
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
    - name: sidecar-logger
      image: busybox
      command: ["sh", "-c", "while true; do echo sidecar running; sleep 5; done"]
```

#### Key Characteristics:
- Shared network: All containers use the same IP and can communicate via localhost.

- Shared storage (optional): Can use volumes to share data.

- Tightly coupled: Designed to work together in a single unit.

```bash
$ kubectl -n elastic-stack logs kibana

# The application outputs logs to the file /log/app.log. View the logs and try to identify the user having issues with Login.

$ kubectl -n elastic-stack exec -it app -- cat /log/app.log
```

There are 3 common patterns when it comes to designing multi-container PODs. The first, and what we just saw with the logging service example, is known as a **sidecar pattern**. The others are the **adapter** and the **ambassador pattern.**

However, these fall under the CKAD curriculum and are not required for the CKA exam. So, we will discuss these in more detail in the CKAD course.
