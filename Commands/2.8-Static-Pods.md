## Static Pods

Static Pods are pods directly managed by the kubelet on a specific node, without involving the Kubernetes API server.

They do not get scheduled by the scheduler.

They are defined in a local YAML file on the node itself.

kubelet watches a directory (e.g., */etc/kubernetes/manifests*) and creates the pods described in the files there.

kubelet.service
  --pod-manifest-path=/etc/kubernetes/manifests\\
or
  --config=kubeconfig.yaml

## How Static Pods Work

Configuration Location:


- Kubelet is started with a flag like:

``` bash
--pod-manifest-path=/etc/kubernetes/manifests 
```

Kubelet Behavior:

 - Kubelet continuously monitors this directory.

 - If a new YAML file is added, it creates the pod.

 - If the file is updated or deleted, the pod is updated or removed accordingly.

No Controllers:

- No Deployment, DaemonSet, etc.

- No scheduling decision — the pod only runs on that node.

## How They Appear in Kubernetes
Static pods do appear in ``` kubectl get pods```, but:

Their name will include the node name as a suffix.

They are bound to a single node.

They are managed via the kubelet, not the API server.
| Use Case                      | Reason                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bootstrapping the cluster** | Control plane components like `kube-apiserver`, `kube-controller-manager`, etc., are often run as static pods. |
| **Single-node clusters**      | Useful for edge devices or IoT setups.                                                                         |
| **Air-gapped environments**   | Where centralized API management is unavailable.                                                               |
| **Debugging / development**   | Quickly run a pod on a node without needing a scheduler.                                                       |


## Example of setting up static pods
Save this file as 

**/etc/kubernetes/manifests/nginx**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-static
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```
#### **Limitations**
- No self-healing (no ReplicaSet to recreate the pod if it crashes).

- Not portable across nodes (static to one machine).

- Limited visibility in terms of Kubernetes features (like autoscaling, deployments).

- we cannot update or delete static pods using ``` kubectl ``` as it is managed by kubelet directly we need to achieve these by updating manifest file .

## Static pods vs Daemon Sets

| Feature                        | **Static Pod**                                                                | **DaemonSet**                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Managed by**                 | `kubelet` directly on the node                                                | Kubernetes control plane (via API server & scheduler) |
| **Controller Involved**        | ❌ No controller                                                               | ✅ Managed by a DaemonSet controller                   |
| **Deployment method**          | YAML file in `--pod-manifest-path` on node (e.g. `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`) | Created using `kubectl apply -f` or via Helm, etc.    |
| **Scheduling**                 | Manually placed on the node (no scheduler involved)                           | Automatically scheduled to all (or selected) nodes    |
| **API Server visibility**      | ✅ Yes, but read-only from kubelet (not fully managed)                         | ✅ Full visibility and management through API          |
| **Pod Lifecycle Management**   | Manual — file update/delete on node                                           | Handled by Kubernetes, declarative and auto-managed   |
| **Self-healing**               | ❌ No — kubelet recreates only if file is present                              | ✅ Yes — if a pod crashes, DaemonSet will re-create it |
| **Use Case**                   | Bootstrapping core components (e.g., kube-apiserver)                          | Running agents/loggers/monitors on every node         |
| **Portability**                | Node-specific only                                                            | Portable and cluster-wide                             |
| **Rolling updates / upgrades** | ❌ Manual                                                                      | ✅ Supported                                           |
