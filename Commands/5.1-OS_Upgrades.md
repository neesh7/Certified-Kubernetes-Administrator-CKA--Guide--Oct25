Taking down nodes as part of maintainance of cluster or upgrading base s/w or applying patches .

if one of nodes goes down, pods on them are not accesible, if the node was down for more than 5 minutes then the pods are terminated from that node. 


Node management commands in Kubernetes, primarily used for maintenance, upgrades, or rebalancing workloads across the cluster:

```bash
# Marks node-1 as unschedulable
$ kubectl cordon node-1

# Safely evicts all pods from node-1
$ kubectl drain node-1

# Re-enables scheduling on node-1
$ kubectl uncordon node-1
```
## ✅ $ kubectl cordon node-1
**Purpose:**

Marks node-1 as unschedulable.

**Effect:**

- New pods will NOT be scheduled on node-1.

- Existing pods continues running.

**Use Case:**

When you want to temporarily stop using a node (e.g., before maintenance) without disrupting current workloads.

## ✅ $ kubectl drain node-1
Purpose:
Safely evicts all pods from node-1.

**Effect:**

- Cordon is automatically done (i.e., node is marked unschedulable).

- Evicts all non-daemonset, non-mirrored pods.

- Respectful of PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs).

**Use Case:**

When you want to take a node out of service, e.g., for:

- OS updates

- Node termination

- Hardware changes
```bash
$ kubectl drain node-1 --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data
```
## ✅ $ kubectl uncordon node-1
**Purpose:**

Re-enables scheduling on node-1.

**Effect:**
- Node becomes schedulable again.

- Kubernetes can place new pods on it.

**Use Case:**

After maintenance is complete and you're ready to bring the node back into the cluster for normal operation.

```bash
# 1. Prepare for maintenance
$ kubectl cordon node-1

# 2. Drain running pods safely
$ kubectl drain node-1 --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data

# --- Perform maintenance here ---

# 3. Re-enable node
$ kubectl uncordon node-1
```
